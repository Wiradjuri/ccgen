### luhn algorithm


Choose a Number Sequence:

    Start with a random sequence of numbers. For example, let's say your sequence is 4567 1234 5678.

2. Apply the Luhn Algorithm to Determine the Final Digit:

    Starting from the right, double every second digit. If the doubled value is greater than 9, subtract 9 from it.
    Sum all the digits.
    The final digit (check digit) makes the total a multiple of 10. To find it, compute (10 - (total sum % 10)) % 10.

Example:

    Given sequence: 4567 1234 567_
    Double every second digit and modify if necessary:
        8_12_10_8_
    Sum all the numbers including the undoubled digits:
        4+8+5+1+2+2+3+1+0+5+6+8 = 45
    Calculate the check digit:
        (10 - (45 % 10)) % 10 = 5
    Complete sequence: 4567 1234 5675
    3. Add the Check Digit to the Right Side of Your Sequence:
    The final number in the sequence should be the check digit you calculated earlier. In this case, it would be "5".
